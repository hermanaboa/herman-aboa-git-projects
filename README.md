# if, then, fi 

if: The if statement is the starting point of a conditional block. 

It is used to evaluate a condition. If the condition is true, the code inside the then block is executed.

then: The then keyword follows the if statement. 

It signifies the beginning of the block of code that should be executed if the condition specified in the if statement is true.

fi: The fi keyword is used to terminate the if statement. 

It's essentially the reverse of if and is required to close the conditional block. It signifies the end of the block of code that is conditionally executed.
